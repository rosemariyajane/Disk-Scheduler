# Disk-Scheduler
An interactive Flask-based web simulator that visualizes FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN disk scheduling algorithms. Users enter custom requests and head positions, see real-time disk head movement, and view metrics like seek sequence, total seek time, average seek time, and throughput.
